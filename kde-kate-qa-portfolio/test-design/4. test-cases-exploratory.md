# Exploratory Test
**Kate – Language Selection**

## Overview
This document contains **exploratory test activities** for the *Language Selection* feature in **Kate (KDE text editor)**.  
The focus is on investigating intermittent or unstable behavior under varying conditions.

## TC-EXP-01 – Dropdown scroll behavior under varying conditions
**Type:** Exploratory  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Related area:** Settings → Language

### Objective
Investigate how the Primary Language dropdown scroll behavior varies depending on user interaction method and runtime conditions.

### Test Charter
- Investigate dropdown scrolling behavior
- Identify conditions under which scrolling fails or works
- Observe impact of environment, timing, and input method

### Test Environment
- OS: Kubuntu 26.04 snapshot (Dec 2025)
- Execution: Virtual Machine (UTM)
- Display server: Wayland
- Input: Mouse, trackpad, keyboard
- Hardware constraints: Limited VM resources
- Observation date: 2026-01-28

### Exploration Areas
- Repeated opening and closing of the Configure Language dialog
- Different input methods (mouse wheel, trackpad, keyboard)
- Timing of interaction (immediate vs delayed interaction)
- Application restart vs same session
- VM performance state (fresh boot vs long-running session)

### Observations
- Scroll behavior varies depending on interaction method.
- Mouse wheel interaction occasionally prevents scrolling.
- Keyboard navigation appears more stable.
- The issue is more likely to occur immediately after opening the dialog.
- Behavior is reproducible under certain interaction sequences.

### Hypothesis
The scrolling instability may be related to focus handling or input event processing when the dropdown is first rendered.

### Notes
- The issue is reproducible when specific interaction sequences are followed.
- Additional validation is required to confirm whether the root cause is focus-related or input-event handling related.

### Outcome
The exploratory session allowed identification of interaction-dependent scrolling instability.
