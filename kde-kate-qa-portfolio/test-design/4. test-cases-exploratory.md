# Exploratory Test
**Kate – Language Selection**

## Overview
This document contains **exploratory test activities** for the *Language Selection* feature in **Kate (KDE text editor)**.  
The focus is on investigating interaction-dependent UI behavior observed on first opening under varying conditions.

## TC-EXP-DropdownScroll-01 – Dropdown scroll behavior under varying conditions
**Type:** Exploratory  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Related area:** Settings → Language

### Objective
Investigate how the Primary and Fallback Language dropdown scroll behavior varies depending on initial user interaction and runtime conditions, especially on first opening.

### Test Charter
- Investigate dropdown scrolling behavior
- Identify conditions under which scrolling fails or works
- Observe impact of environment, timing, and input method

### Test Environment
- OS: Kubuntu 26.04 snapshot (Dec 2025)
- Execution: Virtual Machine (UTM)
- Display server: Wayland
- Input: Mouse, trackpad, keyboard
- Hardware constraints: Limited VM resources
- Observation date: 2026-01-28

### Exploration Areas
- Repeated opening and closing of the Configure Language dialog
- Different input methods (mouse wheel, trackpad, keyboard)
- Timing of interaction (immediate vs delayed interaction)
- Application restart vs same session
- VM performance state (fresh boot vs long-running session)
- Compare behavior between Primary and Fallback dropdowns
- Identify which initial interactions enable scrolling (mouse selection, type-to-select, reopening)

### Observations
- The scroll issue occurs on the first opening of the dropdown (Primary and Fallback).
- Scrolling is disabled until an initial selection interaction occurs.
- The behavior becomes normal after one of the following interactions:
  - clicking on one of the visible languages in the dropdown, or
  - typing a letter to jump to the first matching language (type-to-select), which also closes the dropdown.
- After this initial interaction, reopening the dropdown allows scrolling to work correctly.

### Hypothesis
The scrolling instability may be related to focus handling or input event processing when the dropdown is first rendered.

### Notes
- The issue is reproducible on first opening and appears to be mitigated by an initial selection/focus interaction.
- Further validation is needed to determine whether this is focus initialization, event handling, or rendering timing.

### Outcome
Interaction-dependent scroll instability was identified in both Primary and Fallback dropdowns on first opening.
