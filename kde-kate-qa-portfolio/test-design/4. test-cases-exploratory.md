# Exploratory Test – Kate Language Selection

## TC-EXP-01 – Dropdown scroll behavior under varying conditions

### Objective
Explore the behavior of the Primary Language dropdown when the list of available languages exceeds the visible area, focusing on intermittent scrolling issues.

### Test Charter
- Investigate dropdown scrolling behavior
- Identify conditions under which scrolling fails or works
- Observe impact of environment, timing, and input method

### Test Environment
- OS: Kubuntu 26.04 snapshot (Dec 2025)
- Execution: Virtual Machine (UTM)
- Display server: Wayland
- Input: Mouse, trackpad, keyboard
- Hardware constraints: Limited VM resources
- Observation date: 2026-01-28

### Exploration Areas
- Repeated opening and closing of the Configure Language dialog
- Different input methods (mouse wheel, trackpad, keyboard)
- Timing of interaction (immediate vs delayed interaction)
- Application restart vs same session
- VM performance state (fresh boot vs long-running session)

### Observations
- Scrolling behavior is intermittent
- In some attempts, dropdown scrolls correctly
- In other attempts, scrolling is not possible and items beyond the visible area are unreachable
- Scrolling behavior may be inconsistent across repeated openings of the dropdown

### Notes
- Issue is not consistently reproducible
- Further investigation needed to isolate root cause
