## TC-EDGE-01 – Language dropdown scroll instability (Primary and Fallback)
**Type:** Edge  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Related area:** Settings → Language

### Preconditions
- Kubuntu VM is running and responsive
- Kate is installed and launched
- The Language settings dialog is accessible
- The number of available languages exceeds the visible dropdown area

### Steps
1. Launch Kate
2. Open **Settings → Configure Language…**
3. Open the **Primary Language** dropdown
4. Attempt to scroll the dropdown list:
   - Use mouse wheel / trackpad scrolling
   - Use keyboard navigation (Down Arrow / PageDown)
5. Repeat the same actions with the **Fallback Language** dropdown (if configured)
6. Try to reach languages that are not initially visible

### Expected Result
- The dropdown list scrolls correctly when the number of languages exceeds the visible area.
- The user can reach and select any language in both Primary and Fallback dropdowns.
- No UI inconsistencies occur.

### Actual Result
- The dropdown list does not always scroll.
- Languages beyond the visible area cannot consistently be reached.
- The issue occurs intermittently.
- The behavior is reproducible in both Primary and Fallback Language dropdowns.

### Notes
- The issue appears to be related to the dropdown component behavior.
- The problem is not consistently reproducible but occurs after multiple dialog openings.
- The issue affects both Primary and Fallback Language selection.
