(What happens when things go wrong or are unusual?)- Resiste/Non si rompe

## Overview

## TC-ED-FallbackEqualsPrimary-02 – Fallback Language identical to Primary is not persisted after restart
**Type:** Edge  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Related area:** Settings → Language

### Preconditions
- Kubuntu VM is running and responsive
- Kate is installed
- The Language settings dialog is accessible

### Steps (User)
1. Launch Kate
2. Open **Settings → Configure Language…**
3. Click on **Add Fallback Language**
4. Open the **Fallback Language** dropdown
5. Select the same language as the Primary language
  - If the Fallback dropdown list cannot be scrolled, use type-to-select (type the first letter of the desired language)
6. Click **OK** to confirm
7. If an informational message dialog appears, click OK to close it.
8. Restart Kate
9. Open **Settings → Configure Language…** again

### Expected Result (What system does)
- The configuration remains valid after restart.
- The application does **not** keep a duplicate fallback entry equal to the Primary Language.
- After restart, one of the following outcomes is observed:
  - A) The identical fallback selection is not present (fallback list is empty or unchanged), or
  - B) The UI prevents selecting the same language as Primary (during step 6).
- No misleading or error messages are shown.

### Actual Result (Observed)
- The identical fallback selection is accepted.
- A message is displayed indicating that the changes will take effect after restart.
- After restarting, the fallback language identical to the Primary language is not persisted and disappears.

### Notes
- The observed behavior suggests that identical fallback and primary languages are removed when the configuration is reloaded. 
- However, the restart message may be misleading, as the configuration is not effectively persisted.
- It is unclear whether this behavior is by design or a UI inconsistency.
